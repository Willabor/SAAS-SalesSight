   - Silhouette score: 0.266 (decent clustering quality)

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - 100 trees, max depth 15
   - Balanced class weights (handles imbalanced segments)
   - Trains on rule-based segment labels
   - Test accuracy: 99.5%

3. **Feature Engineering (15+ features):**
   - **Recency:** `days_since_last_sale`, `days_since_last_receive`
   - **Frequency:** `receive_count`, `units_sold_30d`, `units_sold_90d`
   - **Monetary:** `avg_selling_price`, `avg_margin_percent`, `inventory_value`, `margin_per_unit`
   - **Inventory:** `total_active_qty`, `sales_velocity`, `turnover_rate`
   - **Status Flags:** `is_dead_stock`, `is_new_arrival`, `is_high_frequency`

**Product Segments (10 categories):**
1. **Best Sellers** - High sales + high frequency (Priority 5)
2. **Core High** - 40+ receive count (Priority 4)
3. **Core Medium** - 10-39 receive count (Priority 3)
4. **Core Low** - 6-9 receive count (Priority 2)
5. **Non-Core Repeat** - 2-5 receives (Priority 1)
6. **One-Time Purchase** - Received once
7. **New Arrivals** - Last 60 days, ≤2 receives
8. **Clearance** - 180+ days no sales, dead stock
9. **Summer Items** - Seasonal pattern: Summer
10. **Winter Items** - Seasonal pattern: Winter

#### **New ML Service Endpoints**
- **File:** `ml_service/main.py`

1. **Train Segmentation Model**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/ml/train-segmentation`
   - **Payload:** `{"days_back": 90}`
   - **Returns:** Model version, metrics, training date
   - **Training Time:** ~3-5 seconds

2. **Predict Product Segmentation**
   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/ml/product-segmentation`
   - **Returns:** Segmented products with ML predictions
   - **Includes:** Confidence scores, budget tiers, Google Shopping metadata

**Model Startup:**
- Loads both transfer and segmentation models on startup
- Graceful handling if models don't exist
- Displays model versions in logs

## Architecture

### Data Flow (ML Toggle ON)

```
User toggles "Use AI" → Frontend (useState: true)
  ↓
React Query: queryKey="/api/inventory/ml-product-segmentation"
  ↓
Node.js Backend (server/routes.ts)
  ↓
Proxies to Railway ML Service
  ↓
POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/product-segmentation
  ↓
Python ML Service (main.py):
  1. Query database for product metrics (2,214 products)
  2. Extract 15+ features per product
  3. Scale features with StandardScaler
  4. Predict clusters (K-Means)
  5. Predict segments (Random Forest)
  6. Calculate confidence scores
  7. Enrich with Google Shopping metadata
  8. Group by ML-predicted segments
  ↓
Returns JSON:
{
  "metadata": {
    "modelVersion": "v20251002_120029",
    "mlPowered": true,
    "totalStyles": 2214,
    ...
  },
  "segments": {
    "bestSellers": [...],
    "coreHighFrequency": [...],
    ...
  },
  "mlInsights": {
    "segmentConfidence": {...},
    "recommendedActions": [...]
  }
}
  ↓
Frontend displays:
  - Purple "ML Active" badge
  - Model version
  - Different segment counts (ML predictions)
  - Confidence-based budget tiers
```

### Priority Scoring Formula

```python
ML Priority Score = (ML Confidence × 60) + (Margin % × 0.4)

Budget Tiers:
- High Priority:   Score ≥ 65
- Medium Priority: 45 ≤ Score < 65
- Low Priority:    Score < 45
```

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Local Development
1. Created all frontend and backend files
2. Implemented ML model locally
3. Fixed TypeScript errors
4. Built and tested locally

### Step 2: Git Deployment
1. Committed to main repo: `git push origin main`
2. Deployed ML service code to separate repo:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/test-ml-repo
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Willabor/inventory-ml-service.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Railway Auto-Deployment
1. Railway detected GitHub push
2. Automatic rebuild triggered (~5 minutes)
3. ML service redeployed with new code

### Step 4: Model Training (Post-Deployment)
```bash
# Train Transfer Model
curl -X POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back":90}'

# Train Segmentation Model
curl -X POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/train-segmentation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back":90}'
```

**Results:**
- Transfer Model: `v20251002_120027` (100% accuracy)
- Segmentation Model: `v20251002_120029` (99.5% accuracy)

---

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: ML Toggle Not Changing Numbers
**Problem:** When toggling AI ON, segment counts remained the same.

**Root Cause:** Railway ML service had no trained models loaded (`"model_loaded": false`)

**Why:** Railway uses ephemeral storage - models are deleted on every deployment

**Solution:** Manually train both models after each deployment

---

### Issue 2: Database Query Method Error
**Error:**
```
'DatabaseConnection' object has no attribute 'query'
```

**Root Cause:** Code called `db.query()` but method was named `db.execute_query()`

**Fix:** Replaced all instances of `db.query(query)` with `db.execute_query(query)`

**Files Fixed:**
- `ml_service/models/segmentation_predictor.py`
- `ml_service/main.py`

---

### Issue 3: SQL GROUP BY Clause Error
**Error:**
```sql
column "i.avail_qty" must appear in the GROUP BY clause
or be used in an aggregate function
```

**Root Cause:** PostgreSQL requires all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY

**Fix:** Changed non-aggregated fields to use `MAX()`:
```sql
-- Before
GROUP BY i.style_number, i.item_name, i.category, i.vendor_name, i.gender

-- After
GROUP BY i.style_number
-- With: MAX(i.item_name) as item_name, MAX(i.category) as category, etc.
```

---

### Issue 4: NaN (Not a Number) Conversion Error
**Error:**
```python
ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
```

**Root Cause:** Database returned NaN values for `days_since_last_receive`, trying to convert to int

**Fix:** Added safe conversion helpers:
```python
def safe_int(value, default=0):
    if pd.isna(value) or value is None:
        return None if default is None else default
    try:
        return int(value)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return None if default is None else default

def safe_float(value, default=0.0):
    if pd.isna(value) or value is None:
        return default
    try:
        return float(value)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return default
```

**Files Fixed:** `ml_service/main.py:456-505`

---

### Issue 5: Transfer Model Also Not Working
**Discovery:** Both Transfer Recommendations AND Google Marketing toggles had the same issue

**Verification:**
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
# Output: {"model_loaded": false, "model_version": null}
```

**Solution:** Train both models after deployment (same as Issue 1)

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. **Ephemeral Storage on Railway** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem:**
- Railway uses ephemeral filesystem (non-persistent)
- Trained models are stored in `./models/cache/` directory
- Every deployment wipes the filesystem
- Models must be retrained after every deploy

**Impact:**
- ML toggles stop working after Railway redeploys
- Both Transfer and Segmentation models affected
- Manual intervention required after each deployment

**Current Workaround:**
- Manually train models via API after each deploy
- Models persist until next deployment/restart

### 2. **No Model Persistence Between Deployments**
**Triggers that cause model loss:**
- Code push to GitHub (auto-redeploy)
- Railway service restart
- Railway platform maintenance
- Environment variable changes

### 3. **Training Time on Startup**
**Current State:**
- Models NOT trained on startup
- Service starts without models loaded
- Health check shows `"model_loaded": false` initially

**If Auto-Training Was Enabled:**
- Would add ~2 minutes to deployment time
- Transfer model: ~3 seconds
- Segmentation model: ~5 seconds
- Total startup delay: ~8-10 seconds

### 4. **No Prediction Caching**
- Every toggle generates new predictions
- No caching of ML results
- Could be optimized for frequently accessed data

### 5. **No A/B Testing Capability**
- Can't compare ML vs rule-based performance
- No metrics tracking which performs better
- No user feedback collection

---

## Permanent Solutions Needed

### **Option 1: Auto-Train on Startup** ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Implementation:**
Modify Railway startup script to automatically train both models.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic - no manual intervention
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ Always works after deployment
- ✅ Models always available

**Cons:**
- ❌ Adds ~2 minutes to deployment time
- ❌ Retrains every deploy (unnecessary computation)
- ❌ Higher Railway compute usage

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create startup script: `ml_service/startup.sh`
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Starting ML service..."

   # Start server in background
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT &
   SERVER_PID=$!

   # Wait for server to be ready
   sleep 5

   # Train both models
   echo "Training models..."
   curl -X POST http://localhost:$PORT/api/ml/train \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"days_back":90}'

   curl -X POST http://localhost:$PORT/api/ml/train-segmentation \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"days_back":90}'

   echo "Models trained. Service ready."

   # Bring server to foreground
   wait $SERVER_PID
   ```

2. Update `railway.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "build": {
       "builder": "NIXPACKS"
     },
     "deploy": {
       "startCommand": "bash startup.sh",
       "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
     }
   }
   ```

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 15 minutes

---

### **Option 2: Store Models in PostgreSQL**

**Implementation:**
Save trained models as binary blobs in the database.

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE ml_model_artifacts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    model_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    model_version VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    model_data BYTEA NOT NULL,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(model_type, model_version)
);
```

**Code Changes:**
1. Modify `save_model()` to save to database:
   ```python
   def save_model_to_db(self):
       import pickle
       from utils.database import db

       model_data = pickle.dumps({
           'model': self.classification_model,
           'cluster_model': self.cluster_model,
           'scaler': self.scaler,
           'version': self.model_version,
           'metrics': self.metrics
       })

       db.execute_update(
           "INSERT INTO ml_model_artifacts (model_type, model_version, model_data, metadata) "
           "VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s) "
           "ON CONFLICT (model_type, model_version) DO UPDATE SET model_data = EXCLUDED.model_data",
           ('segmentation', self.model_version, model_data, json.dumps(self.metrics))
       )
   ```

2. Modify `load_latest()` to load from database:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def load_latest_from_db(cls):
       from utils.database import db

       result = db.execute_query(
           "SELECT model_data FROM ml_model_artifacts "
           "WHERE model_type = 'segmentation' "
           "ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
       )

       if result.empty:
           raise FileNotFoundError("No model in database")

       model_data = pickle.loads(result.iloc[0]['model_data'])
       predictor = cls()
       predictor.classification_model = model_data['model']
       predictor.cluster_model = model_data['cluster_model']
       predictor.scaler = model_data['scaler']
       predictor.model_version = model_data['version']
       predictor.metrics = model_data['metrics']
       return predictor
   ```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Models persist across deployments
- ✅ Fast startup (no training needed)
- ✅ Version history in database
- ✅ Can rollback to previous models
- ✅ No additional Railway costs

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Increases database size (models are ~5-10MB each)
- ❌ Requires database schema migration

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### **Option 3: Railway Volumes** (Persistent Storage)

**Implementation:**
Use Railway's persistent volume feature (requires Pro plan).

**Steps:**
1. Upgrade to Railway Pro plan ($20/month)
2. Create a volume in Railway dashboard
3. Mount volume to `/models` directory
4. Models persist across deployments

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple - just mount a volume
- ✅ Fast startup
- ✅ Native Railway solution
- ✅ No code changes needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Costs $20/month (Railway Pro)
- ❌ Additional volume storage costs
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Railway

**Estimated Cost:** $20-25/month
