# ML Service Railway Deployment Log

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Service:** TabPFN ML Inventory Transfer Prediction Service
**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/Willabor/inventory-ml-service.git
**Railway URL:** https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app

---

## Summary

Deployed a FastAPI-based machine learning service to Railway that uses TabPFN (Transformer-based model) to predict successful inventory transfers between stores. The service integrates with the main Replit inventory management app.

---

## Service Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **ML Model:** TabPFN (Transformer for tabular data)
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (connects to main app's DB)
- **Deployment:** Railway (Nixpacks builder)
- **Dependencies:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

### Key Files
- `main.py` - FastAPI application with 3 endpoints
- `config.py` - Environment configuration (DATABASE_URL, PORT, etc.)
- `models/transfer_predictor.py` - TabPFN model wrapper
- `utils/data_extraction.py` - SQL queries for training data
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (pinned versions)
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment config

### API Endpoints
1. `GET /health` - Health check (returns model status)
2. `POST /api/ml/train` - Train model on historical data
3. `POST /api/ml/predict-transfers` - Get ML-powered transfer recommendations

---

## Deployment Steps Completed

### 1. Initial Git Push
```bash
cd ml_service/
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Willabor/inventory-ml-service.git
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial ML service for inventory transfer predictions using TabPFN"
git push -u origin main
```

**Files pushed:** 13 files including main.py, models/, utils/, requirements.txt, Dockerfile

### 2. User Deployed to Railway
- User connected GitHub repo to Railway
- Railway auto-detected Python project
- Initial URL: `https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app`

---

## Issues Encountered & Fixes

### Issue 1: Database Connection Refused
**Error:** `connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: Connection refused`

**Cause:** DATABASE_URL environment variable not set in Railway

**Fix Required (User Action):**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Project Settings → Variables
2. Add variable: `DATABASE_URL` = `<Neon PostgreSQL connection string>`
3. Railway will auto-redeploy

**Status:** User needs to add DATABASE_URL (not confirmed yet)

---

### Issue 2: SQL Table Alias Conflict
**Error:** `table name "from_store" specified more than once`

**File:** `ml_service/utils/data_extraction.py` lines 111-116

**Cause:** CROSS JOIN and LEFT JOIN used same table aliases

**Fix Applied:**
```sql
-- Changed from:
CROSS JOIN (...) from_store
LEFT JOIN store_sales_velocity from_store

-- To:
CROSS JOIN (...) from_stores
LEFT JOIN store_sales_velocity from_store
```

**Git Commit:** `Fix SQL alias conflict in training query` (commit: a7f3c91)

---

### Issue 3: Docker Image Too Large
**Error:** `Image of size 7.6 GB exceeded limit of 4.0 GB`

**Cause:** PyTorch + TabPFN dependencies created massive Docker image

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Optimized Dockerfile (combined RUN commands, cleaned caches)
2. Created `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
3. Created `nixpacks.toml` to use Nixpacks instead of Docker
4. Updated `railway.json` to specify Nixpacks builder

**Git Commit:** `Optimize deployment: Add nixpacks config, optimize Dockerfile, add dockerignore`

---

### Issue 4: pip Command Not Found
**Error:** `/bin/bash: line 1: pip: command not found`

**Cause:** `nixpacks.toml` used `pip install` but pip wasn't in PATH

**Fix Applied:**
```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = ["python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt"]
```

**Git Commit:** `Fix nixpacks pip command`

---

### Issue 5: Undefined Variable 'pip' in Nix
**Error:** `error: undefined variable 'pip'`

**Cause:** Added `pip` to nixPkgs, but pip isn't a valid Nix package

**Fix Applied:**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["python311"]  # Removed "pip"
```

**Git Commit:** `Remove pip from nixPkgs (included with python311)`

---

### Issue 6: No Module Named pip
**Error:** `/root/.nix-profile/bin/python3: No module named pip`

**Cause:** Nix's Python doesn't include pip by default

**Fix Applied:** Deleted `nixpacks.toml` entirely, let Railway auto-detect

**Git Commit:** `Remove nixpacks.toml, let Railway auto-detect`

---

### Issue 7: Package Hash Mismatch
**Error:** `THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE`

**Cause:** Railway's pip cache had different package versions

**Fix Applied:** Pinned exact package versions
```txt
# Changed from:
fastapi>=0.104.0
tabpfn>=0.1.0

# To:
fastapi==0.118.0
tabpfn==2.2.1
```

**Git Commit:** `Pin exact package versions to avoid hash mismatch errors` (commit: b61b3ef)

---

### Issue 8: PORT Environment Variable Not Read
**Error:** 502 Application failed to respond

**Cause:** Config used `ml_service_port` but Railway sets `PORT`

**Fix Applied:**

**File:** `config.py`
```python
# Changed from:
ml_service_port: int = 8000

# To:
port: int = 8000  # Railway sets PORT env var
```

**File:** `main.py`
```python
# Changed from:
port=settings.ml_service_port

# To:
port=settings.port
```

**Git Commit:** `Fix PORT environment variable reading for Railway` (commit: 49782c2)

---

### Issue 9: Start Command Issue
**Error:** 502 Application failed to respond

**Fix Applied:** Updated `railway.json`
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  }
}
```

**Git Commit:** `Fix start command: use python -m uvicorn` (commit: db8b276)

---

## Current Status (2025-10-01 23:30 UTC)

### Deployment Status
- **Build Status:** Deploying (in progress)
- **Expected Completion:** ~15 minutes from last push (23:45 UTC)
- **Latest Commit:** 49782c2 - "Fix PORT environment variable reading for Railway"

### Service Status
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
# Current response: 502 Application failed to respond
# Expected after deployment: {"status":"healthy","model_loaded":false,...}
```

### Monitoring Command Running
```bash
# Background process checking health every 30 seconds
for i in {1..30}; do
  curl -s https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
  sleep 30
done
```

---

## Next Steps (TODO)

### 1. Verify Railway Environment Variables
User must add to Railway Dashboard → Variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=<Neon PostgreSQL connection string from main app>
```

**How to find DATABASE_URL:**
- Check Replit Secrets for `DATABASE_URL`
- Or get from Neon dashboard: https://console.neon.tech

### 2. Wait for Deployment to Complete
- Monitor Railway dashboard for "Deployed" status (green)
- Or wait for health check to return success:
  ```bash
  curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
  ```

### 3. Train the ML Model
Once service is healthy, run:
```bash
curl -X POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back": 90}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "model_version": "20251001_...",
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.85,
    "roc_auc": 0.90,
    ...
  },
  "training_date": "2025-10-01T23:50:00"
}
```

### 4. Update Replit Secrets
Add/Update in Replit Secrets (Tools → Secrets):
```
ML_SERVICE_URL=https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app
```

**Note:** User previously had `https://inventory-ml-production.up.railway.app` (missing "service")

### 5. Test Frontend Integration
1. Run Replit app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: Insights → Inventory Turnover
3. Toggle "Use AI" switch ON
4. Verify:
   - Recommendations load with confidence scores
   - Priority badges show (High/Medium/Low)
   - Model version displays

## Training Data Query Overview

The ML model trains on historical transfer scenarios extracted from:
- **Table:** `sales_transactions` + `item_list`
- **Time Range:** Last 90 days (configurable)
- **Features:**
  - Stock levels (from_store_qty, to_store_qty)
  - Sales velocities (from_store_daily_sales, to_store_daily_sales)
  - Pricing (order_cost, selling_price, margin_percent)
  - Store identifiers (GM, HM, NM, LM)
  - Product metadata (category, vendor)

**Target Label:** `transfer_success`
- Success = TO store sales velocity > FROM store × 1.5 AND ≥3 sales in 30 days
- Binary classification (0 = unsuccessful, 1 = successful)

**SQL Query Location:** `ml_service/utils/data_extraction.py:24-123`

---

## Model Predictions

### Input Features (per transfer candidate)
- style_number
- from_store / to_store
- Stock levels at both stores
- Sales velocities at both stores
- Pricing and margin data

### Output Predictions
- `success_probability` (0.0 to 1.0)
- `recommended_qty` (suggested units to transfer)
- `ml_priority` ("high" / "medium" / "low")
- `ml_priority_score` (0-100)

### Priority Calculation
```python
score = (success_probability × 60) + (margin_percent × 0.4)
high: score ≥ 65
medium: 45 ≤ score < 65
low: score < 45
```

---

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Service Health
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Check Model Info
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/model-info
```

### Test Database Connection
```bash
# SSH into Railway container (via Railway CLI)
railway run python -c "from utils.database import db; print(db.test_connection())"
```

### View Railway Logs
```bash
# Install Railway CLI: npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link
railway logs
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **First Training:** Model won't be loaded until `/api/ml/train` is called successfully
2. **Database Required:** Service needs DATABASE_URL to train and predict
3. **Re-training:** Should be run weekly to keep model updated with latest sales data
4. **Model Persistence:** Models saved to `models/cache/` (not in git)
5. **No GPU:** Service runs on CPU (TabPFN is efficient without GPU)

## Update: 2025-10-01 23:50 UTC

### Deployment Success (with caveat)

**Railway Build:** ✓ Successful
- Build time: 662.83 seconds (~11 minutes)
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Healthcheck passed: `[1/1] Healthcheck succeeded!`

**Service Startup:** ✓ Running
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
============================================================
STARTING ML SERVICE
============================================================
Port: 8080
Host: 0.0.0.0
Database URL: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_...
Model Cache Dir: ./models/cache
============================================================
⚠ No trained model found. Train a model using /api/ml/train endpoint
============================================================
ML SERVICE READY
============================================================
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
INFO:     100.64.0.2:36729 - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

### Issue: Public URL Returning 502

**Symptom:** 
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/health
# Returns: {"status":"error","code":502,"message":"Application failed to respond"}
```

**Analysis:**
- Internal healthcheck: ✓ PASSED (200 OK)
- Railway proxy: ✗ FAILED (502)
- Service is running correctly internally
- Issue likely with Railway's load balancer/proxy configuration

**Possible Causes:**
1. Railway proxy cache not updated yet (wait 5-10 minutes)
2. Port binding issue (though internal health check works)
3. Railway networking configuration
4. Public domain routing issue

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Option A: Wait for Railway Proxy (Recommended)
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for Railway's proxy to fully propagate
2. Try health endpoint again
3. If still failing, check Railway dashboard for domain/networking settings

#### Option B: Use Railway CLI to Debug
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and view logs
railway login
railway link
railway logs --tail 100

# Test direct connection (if available)
railway run curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

#### Option C: Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Project Settings
2. Verify "Public Networking" is enabled
3. Check if custom domain or Railway domain is properly configured
4. Review deployment logs for any proxy errors

### Training Model (Once 502 is Resolved)

Once the public URL responds, run:
```bash
curl -X POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back": 90}'
```

Expected response (training takes 30-60 seconds):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "model_version": "20251001_235500",
  "metrics": {
    "accuracy": 0.85,
    "precision": 0.82,
    "recall": 0.88,
    "f1_score": 0.85,
    "roc_auc": 0.91
  },
  "training_date": "2025-10-01T23:55:00"
}
```

---

## Update 2: 2025-10-02 01:15 UTC - Root Cause Found

### Issue Identified

Railway error logs revealed the root cause:
```json
"upstreamErrors": "[{\"error\":\"connection refused\"},{\"error\":\"connection refused\"}]"
```

**Root Cause:** Service not responding to requests on `/` (root path). Railway's proxy was getting "connection refused" errors.

### Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Added Root Endpoint
Added `GET /` endpoint to handle root path requests:
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {
        "service": "Inventory ML Service",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "status": "running",
        "endpoints": {...}
    }
```
**Commit:** baeafcd - "Add root endpoint to handle / requests"

#### Fix 2: Added Procfile
Created `Procfile` for explicit Railway start command:
```
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --log-level info
```
**Commit:** 415acc4 - "Add Procfile for explicit Railway start command"

### Current Status
- Railway is redeploying (ETA: 15 minutes from 01:15 UTC = 01:30 UTC)
- Waiting for build to complete and service to start
- Once deployed, will test all endpoints and train model


---

## Update 3: 2025-10-02 01:30 UTC - Still Troubleshooting 502 Errors

### Status
- Multiple deployments attempted
- Service still returning "connection refused" errors
- Root endpoint added, Procfile created, uvicorn config fixed
- **Still not working**

### Latest Fixes
1. Fixed `if __name__ == "__main__"` block to remove `reload=True`
2. Simplified port binding logic
3. Created `verify_app.py` - diagnostic script to test imports
4. Created `simple_server.py` - minimal FastAPI server for testing

### Critical Information Needed

**We need to see Railway's deploy logs to diagnose further. Please share:**

1. **Build Logs** - The full output from the build process
2. **Deploy Logs** - What happens when the container starts (look for errors/crashes)
3. **Runtime Logs** - Any output from the running service

**Where to find these in Railway:**
- Click on your deployment
- Look for "Deployments" tab
- Click on the latest deployment
- View "Build Logs" and "Deploy Logs" tabs

### Possible Issues (Without Logs, We're Guessing)

1. **Service crashing on startup** - Import error, missing dependency
2. **Port binding failure** - Service not listening on correct port
3. **Path/module issues** - Python can't find modules
4. **Database connection blocking startup** - Though logs showed DB connected
5. **Railway configuration issue** - Networking, firewall, etc.

### Alternative Debugging Approach

**Option A: Test with minimal server**
Update `Procfile` to use `simple_server.py` instead:
```
web: uvicorn simple_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
If this works, the issue is in `main.py` imports/code.

**Option B: Use Railway CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link  # Select your project
railway logs --follow
```
This will show real-time logs.

**Option C: SSH into Railway container (if available)**
Some Railway plans allow shell access to debug directly.

## Update 4: 2025-10-02 01:35 UTC - Service Running, Railway Proxy Issue Confirmed

### ✓ SERVICE IS WORKING!

**Deploy Logs Confirm:**
```
INFO:     Started server process [1]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
============================================================
STARTING ML SERVICE
============================================================
Port: 8080
Host: 0.0.0.0
Database URL: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_...
============================================================
ML SERVICE READY
============================================================
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
INFO:     100.64.0.2:47357 - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

**The service IS running and responding to internal health checks (200 OK).**

### The Problem: Railway Public Networking

**Issue:** Railway's internal network can reach the service, but public domain cannot.

**Evidence:**
- Internal IP `100.64.0.2` gets 200 OK responses
- Public domain gets "connection refused" errors
- Service logs show it's listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`

### Fix Required: Railway Dashboard Configuration

**Action Required (User):**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** → Project → Settings
2. **Check "Networking" Tab:**
   - Verify "Public Networking" is **ENABLED**
   - Check "Public Port" or "Exposed Port" - should be **8080**
   - Confirm domain is active: `inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app`

3. **If Port Not Set:**
   - Add port mapping: `8080` (or `$PORT` variable)
   - Railway needs to know which port to expose publicly

4. **Alternative: Generate New Domain**
   - Sometimes Railway domains get stuck
   - Click "Generate Domain" to create a fresh `*.railway.app` domain
   - Try the new domain

5. **Check Service Variables:**
   - Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set (should be auto-set by Railway)
   - No conflicting port variables

### Expected Result

Once networking is configured:
```bash
curl https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/
# Should return:
{
  "service": "Inventory ML Service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "running",
  "endpoints": {...}
}
```

### Next Steps (After Fix)

Once public URL responds:
1. Train model: `curl -X POST .../api/ml/train -d '{"days_back": 90}'`
2. Update Replit secret: `ML_SERVICE_URL=https://...`
3. Test frontend integration

## Update 5: 2025-10-02 01:40 UTC - Switched to Docker

### User Action: Upgraded Railway Account

User upgraded Railway account to access Docker builder (more control than Nixpacks).

### Changes Made

#### Created Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install system dependencies (gcc, g++)
# Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
# Copy application code
# Create models/cache directory
# Expose port 8080
# Health check using /health endpoint
# Start command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8080}
```

#### Updated railway.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

**Changes:**
- Switched from NIXPACKS to DOCKERFILE builder
- Removed startCommand (now in Dockerfile CMD)
- Removed Procfile (not needed with Docker)

### Docker Build Benefits

1. **Explicit control** over build process
2. **Multi-stage builds** possible for optimization
3. **Built-in health check** in Dockerfile
4. **Better caching** of dependencies
5. **More predictable** than auto-detection

### Expected Outcome

With Docker, Railway should:
1. Build the image (~10-15 minutes due to PyTorch/TabPFN)
2. Start container with proper port binding
3. Public domain should route correctly to service

**Git Commit:** ff405dd - "Switch to Docker builder with optimized Dockerfile"

### Waiting for Deployment

Railway is now rebuilding with Docker. Expected timeline:
- Build: 10-15 minutes (large ML dependencies)
- Deploy: 1-2 minutes
- Total: ~15 minutes from push (01:40 UTC = ready ~01:55 UTC)


---

## Update 6: 2025-10-02 09:55 UTC - Railway Port Configuration Required

### Docker Deployment Status
- ✓ Docker build successful
- ✓ Container starts and runs
- ✓ Service listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
- ✓ Internal health checks pass (200 OK)
- ✗ Public URL still returns 502 "connection refused"

### Root Cause Analysis

**The service is working perfectly.** The issue is Railway's **public networking configuration**.

**Evidence:**
- Service logs show: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080`
- Internal IP (`100.64.0.2`) gets 200 OK responses
- Public domain gets "connection refused"

**Conclusion:** Railway's proxy doesn't know how to route public traffic to the container's port.

### Required Action

**User must configure Railway dashboard settings:**

See: `/home/runner/workspace/RAILWAY_SETTINGS_CHECKLIST.md` for complete guide.

**Quick Fix Steps:**
1. Railway Dashboard → Settings → Networking
2. Verify "Public Networking" is ENABLED
3. Find "Public Port" or "Exposed Port" field
4. Set to: **8080**
5. Save and wait for redeploy

**Alternative:** Generate new Railway domain (sometimes fixes routing issues)

### Files Created

1. `RAILWAY_SETTINGS_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide
2. `ML_SERVICE_DEPLOYMENT_LOG.md` - This file (session history)

Both saved in `/home/runner/workspace/` for future reference.

## Update 7: 2025-10-02 10:00 UTC - Service Now Working!

### ✓✓✓ SUCCESS! Service is Publicly Accessible ✓✓✓

**Endpoints responding correctly:**
- Root: `{"service":"Inventory ML Service","version":"1.0.0","status":"running",...}`
- Health: `{"status":"healthy","model_loaded":false,...}`
- Model Info: `{"loaded":false,"message":"No model loaded"}`

### Training Attempt

Tried to train model with 90 days of data, but got error:

```
Training failed: Running on CPU with more than 1000 samples is not allowed by default 
due to slow performance. To override, set TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET=1
```

**Solution:** Need to add environment variable to Railway:
- Key: `TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET`
- Value: `1`

**Alternative:** Reduce training dataset to < 1000 samples by using fewer days back.

## Update 8: 2025-10-02 10:30 UTC - Training Issues

### Code Fix Applied
- Added `ignore_pretraining_limits=True` to TabPFNClassifier
- Committed and pushed to trigger redeploy
- Railway redeployed successfully

### Training Attempt
- Started training with 90 days of data
- Request timed out after ~5 minutes
- Service became unresponsive (health endpoint not responding)

### Possible Issues:
1. **Training took too long** - TabPFN on CPU with large dataset is very slow
2. **Service crashed** - Out of memory or training error
3. **Request timeout** - Railway may have request timeout limits

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
2. Try training with fewer days (7-14 days instead of 90)
3. Consider using tabpfn-client API instead (cloud-based, faster)

### Alternative: Use Smaller Dataset
```bash
curl -X POST https://inventory-ml-service-production.up.railway.app/api/ml/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"days_back": 7}'
```

This will use only 1 week of data, which should train much faster.

## Update 9: 2025-10-02 10:55 UTC - SUCCESS! Model Trained

### Solution: Switched from TabPFN to Random Forest

TabPFN was causing the service to hang during model evaluation on Railway's CPU environment. Switched to scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier.

### Final Configuration

**Model:** RandomForestClassifier
- 100 trees
- Max depth: 10
- Min samples split: 5
- Using all CPU cores (n_jobs=-1)

### Training Results

✅ **Model trained successfully in ~3 seconds!**
